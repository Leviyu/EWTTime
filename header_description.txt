13	Phase name				Either S, SS, SSS, Sdiff, ScS, or ScSScS
14	Measured time			Travel time anomaly of phase onset relative to PREM (observed minus PREM)
15	Predicted time			Travel time prediction of the PREM model
16	Amplitude				Amplitude of the peak of the phase, on instrument-deconvolved velocity recordings
17	Radiation pattern		The predicted amplitude between [-1,1] using the SH radiation pattern
18	Flipped polarity flag	Record was modeled after flipping the record’s polarity (which was explored for a low radiation pattern amplitude range [-0.15,0.15])
19	One period start		The start time, relative to PREM prediction, of the beginning of the time window used to define one period of the phase, measured at the 10% amplitude level preceding the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
20	One period end			The end time, relative to the PREM prediction, of the end of the time window used to define one period of the phase, measured at the 10% amplitude level following the wave peak (used to auto-define the Misfit measurement windows)
21	SNRaverage_amp			The signal-to-noise measurement from the average amplitude of the signal to the average amplitude of the noise, as in equation (2)
22	SNRpeak-trough			The signal-to-noise measurement from the maximum peak-to-trough measurement within one period of the signal compared to noise, as in equation (3)
23	SNRmax_peak				The signal-to-noise measurement from the maximum peak in the signal window compared to the maximum peak in the entire noise window, as in equation (4)
24	MisfitSIGNAL			The average difference between the phase and the best-fit SEW over one period (see Equation 1)
25	MisfitPRE				As above, except over one period preceding the phase
26	MisfitPOST				As above, except over one period following the phase
27	MisfitPRE_2T			As above, except over one period preceding MisfitPRE
28	MisfitPOST_2T			As above, except over one period following MisfitPOST
29	t* 						The best-fit t* value that, when convolved with the SEW, gives the best fit to records that are broader than the SEW
30	Stretch factor			A measure of the amount the SEW has to be narrowed to fit records that are narrower than the SEW 
31	CCC[rec,SEW]			Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and the best-fitting SEW adapted to the record
32	CCC[rec,GEW]			Cross-correlation coefficient between observed record and GEW, which measures the record’s fit to the average phase shape for the event
33	g_best-fit_SEW			Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (equation 5) to a record’s best-fitting SEW
34	g_event_SEW				Gaussian factor of the best-fitting Gaussian function (equation 5) to the S wave SEW for the event (i.e., unstretched, un-t*’ed, as in Step 3, Section 3.1) 
36	Misfit_g				The misfit measured between g_best-fit_SEW and g_event_SEW (computed as in equation 1) which provides a different measure of record broadening
37	w_comprehensive			An empirical comprehensive weight value for each data (see equation 6)
